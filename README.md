# Cassandra Client with Quarkus

Apache CassandraÂ® is a free and open-source, distributed, wide column store, NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.

In this guide, we'll demonstrate how you can create a REST service to access a Cassandra database and then create a native image executable of the application.

### Credits
This example is based on an article that appears [here](https://quarkus.io/version/1.7/guides/cassandra).

### Preqs
NOTE: Java 11 is used for this example, however, Java 8 would work as well with a slight adjustment to the `pom.xml`.

### Connecting to Apache Cassandra

To connect to the Cassandra database, there are three primary properties to configure: 
* `contact-points` to access the Cassandra database
* `local-datacenter` which is required by the driver
* Optionally, the `keyspace` to bind

A sample configuration (in **src/main/resources/application.properties**) should follow this format:

```
quarkus.cassandra.contact-points={cassandra_ip}:9042
quarkus.cassandra.local-datacenter={dc_name}
quarkus.cassandra.keyspace={keyspace}
```

**NOTE:** To configure the IP for Linux on WSL2, identify the IP by executing the following command:

```
$ ping $(hostname).local
PING sws-ryzen (172.30.112.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
```

In this example, we are using a single instance running on localhost *(IP address from above)*, and the keyspace containing our data is k1:

```
quarkus.cassandra.contact-points=172.30.112.1:9042 
quarkus.cassandra.local-datacenter=datacenter1 
quarkus.cassandra.keyspace=k1
```

### Running the Cassandra Database
For simplicity, we'll use a container to run the Cassandra database.  To start the Cassandra database container, execute:
```
$ docker run --name local-cassandra-instance -p 9042:9042 -d cassandra
```

Next you need to create the keyspace and table that will be used by the application. If you are using Docker (`podman` is good alternative), run the following commands:

```
$ docker exec -it local-cassandra-instance cqlsh -e "CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS k1 WITH replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor':1}"
$ docker exec -it local-cassandra-instance cqlsh -e "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS k1.fruit(name text PRIMARY KEY, description text)"
```

You can also use the CQLSH utility to interactively interrogate your database:

```
$ docker exec -it local-cassandra-instance cqlsh
Connected to Test Cluster at 127.0.0.1:9042.
[cqlsh 5.0.1 | Cassandra 3.11.10 | CQL spec 3.4.4 | Native protocol v4]
Use HELP for help.
cqlsh> select * from k1.fruit;

 name | description
------+-------------

(0 rows)
cqlsh> exit
```

### Building the Project
To build the project, run:
```
$ mvn clean package
```
**NOTE:** We created an `uber-jar` of the application, you can choose to create a `fast-jar` instead.

To start the `jar` application, execute:
```
$ java -jar ./target/cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-*-runner.jar

```

Or run the application in dev mode: 
```
$ mvn clean quarkus:dev
```

### Adding Data and Accessing the UI
Add some data to the database:
```
$ http POST http://localhost:8080/fruits name="apple" description="red and tasty"
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```
**NOTE:** These examples use [http](https://httpie.io/) but of course, `curl` will work too.

Then check to make certain the data posted properly:
```
$ http http://localhost:8080/fruits --body
[
    {
        "description": "red and tasty",
        "name": "apple"
    }
]
```

To access the REST UI, browse to: [http://localhost:8080/fruits.html](http://localhost:8080/fruits.html)

![](images/REST-UI.png)

To access the Reactive UI, browse to: 
[http://localhost:8080/reactive-fruits.html](http://localhost:8080/reactive-fruits.html)

![](images/Reactive-UI-1.png)

You can also add fruit to the database via the UI:

![](images/Reactive-UI-2.png)

### Application Health Check
You can access the `/q/health` endpoint of your application to retrieve information about the connection validation status:

```
$ http http://localhost:8080/q/health --body
{
    "checks": [
        {
            "data": {
                "clusterName": "Test Cluster",
                "cqlVersion": "3.4.4",
                "datacenter": "datacenter1",
                "numberOfNodes": 1,
                "releaseVersion": "3.11.10"
            },
            "name": "DataStax Apache Cassandra Driver health check",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ],
    "status": "UP"
}
```

### Create a Native Image Executable
To build a native image, execute the following command:

```
$ mvn package -Dnative
```

Once the compilation has finished, you can run the native executable by executing the following command:

```
$ ./target/cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-*-runner
__  ____  __  _____   ___  __ ____  ______
 --/ __ \/ / / / _ | / _ \/ //_/ / / / __/
 -/ /_/ / /_/ / __ |/ , _/ ,< / /_/ /\ \
--\___\_\____/_/ |_/_/|_/_/|_|\____/___/
2021-04-09 13:34:09,037 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) cassandra-quarkus-quickstart 1.0.1 native (powered by Quarkus 1.13.1.Final) started in 0.018s. Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8080
2021-04-09 13:34:09,037 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Profile prod activated.
2021-04-09 13:34:09,038 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Installed features: [cassandra-client, cdi, micrometer, mutiny, resteasy, resteasy-jsonb, resteasy-mutiny, smallrye-context-propagation, smallrye-health]

```
You can then browse to [http://localhost:8080/fruits.html](http://localhost:8080/fruits.html) or [http://localhost:8080/reactive-fruits.html](http://localhost:8080/reactive-fruits.html) and access the application as noted earlier.

Since you're undoubtedly curious, let's compare the JAR and native image file sizes:

```
$ ls -lah target/cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-1.0.1*
-rwxr-xr-x 1 sseighma sseighma  73M Apr  9 12:44 target/cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-1.0.1-runner
-rw-r--r-- 1 sseighma sseighma  35K Apr  9 12:42 target/cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-1.0.1.jar
```
Using [upx](https://upx.github.io/), you can further reduce the size of the native image executable:
```
$ upx -7 -k target/cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-1.0.1-runner
                       Ultimate Packer for eXecutables
                          Copyright (C) 1996 - 2020
UPX 3.96        Markus Oberhumer, Laszlo Molnar & John Reiser   Jan 23rd 2020

        File size         Ratio      Format      Name
   --------------------   ------   -----------   -----------
  75751464 ->  21118728   27.88%   linux/amd64   cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-1.0.1-runner

Packed 1 file.
```

Comparing once again, you can see we reduced the native image executable size from **73MB** to **21MB**.
```
$ ls -lah target/cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-1.0.1*
-rwxr-xr-x 1 sseighma sseighma  21M Apr  9 12:44 target/cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-1.0.1-runner
-rwxr-xr-x 1 sseighma sseighma  73M Apr  9 12:44 target/cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-1.0.1-runne~
-rw-r--r-- 1 sseighma sseighma  35K Apr  9 12:42 target/cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-1.0.1.jar
```

### Creating Container Images

We'll demonstrate a few options to build container images for the application:

* Using the uber-jar 
* Using Native Image
* Using a Distroless Image

First, let's build a container using the **uber-jar** version of the application:

```
$ docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm -t quarkus/cassandra-client-jvm .
```
Run the container:

```
$ docker run -i --rm -p 8080:8080 quarkus/cassandra-client-jvm
exec java -Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0 -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager -javaagent:/opt/agent-bond/agent-bond.jar=jmx_exporter{{9779:/opt/agent-bond/jmx_exporter_config.yml}} -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError -cp . -jar /deployments/app.jar

2021-04-09 16:29:01,847 INFO  [com.dat.oss.dri.int.cor.DefaultMavenCoordinates] (main) DataStax Java driver for Apache Cassandra(R) (com.datastax.oss:java-driver-core) version 4.10.0
2021-04-09 16:29:02,000 INFO  [com.dat.oss.qua.run.int.qua.CassandraClientRecorder] (main) Enabling Cassandra metrics using Micrometer.
2021-04-09 16:29:02,354 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) cassandra-quarkus-quickstart 1.0.1 on JVM (powered by Quarkus 1.13.1.Final) started in 0.789s. Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8080
2021-04-09 16:29:02,354 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Profile prod activated.
2021-04-09 16:29:02,355 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Installed features: [cassandra-client, cdi, micrometer, mutiny, resteasy, resteasy-jsonb, resteasy-mutiny, smallrye-context-propagation, smallrye-health]

```
Notice it starts in ~**800ms**.

Now let's build a container with the **native image** executable:

```
$ docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.native -t quarkus/cassandra-client-native .
```
Run the native image container:
```
$ docker run -i --rm -p 8080:8080 quarkus/cassandra-client-native
__  ____  __  _____   ___  __ ____  ______
 --/ __ \/ / / / _ | / _ \/ //_/ / / / __/
 -/ /_/ / /_/ / __ |/ , _/ ,< / /_/ /\ \
--\___\_\____/_/ |_/_/|_/_/|_|\____/___/
2021-04-09 16:31:10,907 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) cassandra-quarkus-quickstart 1.0.1 native (powered by Quarkus 1.13.1.Final) started in 0.015s. Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8080
2021-04-09 16:31:10,907 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Profile prod activated.
2021-04-09 16:31:10,907 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Installed features: [cassandra-client, cdi, micrometer, mutiny, resteasy, resteasy-jsonb, resteasy-mutiny, smallrye-context-propagation, smallrye-health]

```
Notice the native image version starts considerably faster at ~**15ms**.

If we use the `upx` compressed version of the native image executable, the container image is reduced in size from **179MB** to **132MB** with little impact on startup times.
```
$ docker images | grep native
quarkus/cassandra-client-native     latest    d51068444298   14 seconds ago   132MB
```


Another option to shrink your container images is to consider using a distroless image.  To build a distroless image, run:
```
$ docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.distroless -t quarkus/cassandra-client-distroless .
```

Here we compare the image size of each option:
```
$ docker images
quarkus/cassandra-client-distroless    latest      ae519318cd36   2 hours ago    96MB
quarkus/cassandra-client-native        latest      1077993b8418   2 hours ago    132MB
quarkus/cassandra-client-jvm           latest      7043af3565af   2 hours ago    222MB
```

### Benchmarking Exercise

Thought I would include an option to benchmark the application, primarily for fun and to understand how to create a basic benchmark test.

I'll be using [wrk2](https://github.com/giltene/wrk2) for the actual benchmarks and an extension called [wrk2img](https://github.com/PPACI/wrk2img) to create some nice graphs of our benchmark results.

Assuming you have both tools installed, let's get started!

Included with this repo is a script called `run-test.sh` to run the `wrk` benchmark:
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [ -z "$1" ]
then
        echo "Oops, pass an arg with a name for output"
        echo "Example: ./run-test.sh graalvm-jvm"
        exit 1
fi

name="$1"

echo -n "Performing benchmark tests ... "
wrk --script post.lua --latency --rate 1000 --connections 5 --threads 2 --duration 60s http://localhost:8080/reactive-fruits.html > results/"$name"_1000.txt
wrk --script post.lua --latency --rate 1000 --connections 5 --threads 2 --duration 60s http://localhost:8080/reactive-fruits.html > results/"$name"_1001.txt
wrk --script post.lua --latency --rate 1000 --connections 5 --threads 2 --duration 60s http://localhost:8080/reactive-fruits.html > results/"$name"_1002.txt
wrk --script post.lua --latency --rate 1000 --connections 5 --threads 2 --duration 60s http://localhost:8080/reactive-fruits.html > results/"$name"_final.txt
echo " done."
cat results/"$name"_1000.txt results/"$name"_1001.txt results/"$name"_1002.txt results/"$name"_1003.txt results/"$name"_final.txt | wrk2img --log -n "$name"-1000,"$name"-1001,"$name"-1002,"$name"-1003,"$name_final" results/"$name"-final.png  >> /dev/null
echo ""
echo -n "Creating graph ..."
echo " done."
```

You can adjust the parameters of `wrk` script to fit your environment. We're running four consecutive tests, keeping only the last test for the final graph (see below).

First, let's start the application in JVM mode:
```
$ java -jar ./target/cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-*-runner.jar
```

It's recommended you `warm-up` the JVM by executing a few `time http` commands to access the endpoints.  Plus, the `time http` command can help you understand the time it takes to make a round trip.

Example:
```
$ time http POST http://localhost:8080/fruits name="apple" description="red and tasty"
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

real    0m0.155s
user    0m0.141s
sys     0m0.011s
```
After the JVM is warm, go ahead and start the test.  You'll also need to pass an argument for the output file names.  In this example, I have the application running in JVM mode, so I named the output files accordingly (`graalvm-jvm`):
```
$ ./run-test.sh graalvm-jvm
Performing benchmark tests ... done.

Creating graph ... done.
```
To view the results, check out the `.txt` files in the `results/` directory.  In addition, you'll find a `.png` file with a latency graph representation of the tests.

![](images/graalvm-jvm-final.png)

Stop the JVM application and restart it using the native image version.

```
$ target/cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-*-runner
```

Now, re-run the benchmark test making certain to rename the output file names (in this example, `graalvm-native`):

```
$ ./run-test.sh graalvm-native
Performing benchmark tests ... done.

Creating graph ... done.
```
Once again, view the results in the `results/` directory and open the native image latency `.png` graph.

![](images/graalvm-native-final.png)

Wouldn't it be helpful to compare the results of both tests together in one graph?  You're in luck, there's another script (`combine-graphs.sh`) that will combine the results from both tests into one graph.  Run the script to create the graph:

```
$ ./combine-graphs.sh
Combining graphs ... created graph!
Done.
```
Open the graph to view the combined results:

![](images/combined-1-final.png)

NOTE: The graph reflects only the last tests (after the JVM was warm) in order to provide an accurate result. 

### Summary

Accessing a Cassandra database from a client application is easy with Quarkus and the Cassandra extension, which provides configuration and native image support for the DataStax Java driver for Apache Cassandra.
